class SwarmBase(object):
    """Base class for single-objective Particle Swarm Optimization 
    implementations.

    Note that all methods here are abstract and raises a 
    NotImplementedError when not used. When defining your own swarm, 
    create another class,

    >>> class MySwarm(SwarmBaseClass):
    >>>     def __init__(self):
    >>>        super(MySwarm, self).__init__()

    and define all the necessary methods needed for your 
    implementation.

    Take note that there is no velocity nor position update in this 
    base class. This enables this class to accommodate any variation 
    of the position or velocity update, without enforcing a specific 
    structure.

    If you wish to pattern your update rules to the original PSO by 
    Eberhant et al., simply check the global best and local best
    implementations in this package
